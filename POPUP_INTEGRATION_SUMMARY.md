# Popup Blocker Integration Summary

## Successfully Integrated Components

### 1. Manifest Updates ✅
- Added proper content script injection with MAIN and ISOLATED worlds
- Added "tabs" permission
- Updated web_accessible_resources to include popup_blocker.js

### 2. Content Scripts ✅
- **popup_detector.js** (MAIN world): Overrides window.open, alert, confirm, prompt
- **content.js** (ISOLATED world): Coordinates between popup detection and service worker

### 3. Service Worker Integration ✅
- Added popup attempt handling (`handlePopupAttempt`)
- Added popup decision handling (`handlePopupDecisionNew`)
- Added pending popups storage management
- Added cleanup for closed tabs
- Removed duplicate/old popup blocking code

### 4. UI Components ✅
- **popup_blocker.html**: Modern, clean popup decision interface
- **popup_blocker.js**: Handles user decisions and communication with service worker

### 5. Storage Integration ✅
- Uses chrome.storage.local for popup preferences
- Remembers user choices per domain
- Automatically applies saved preferences

## How It Works

1. **Detection**: `popup_detector.js` runs in MAIN world and overrides popup functions
2. **Coordination**: When popup is blocked, event is sent to `content.js` in ISOLATED world
3. **Communication**: `content.js` sends message to service worker with popup details
4. **Decision**: Service worker opens `popup_blocker.html` for user to allow/block
5. **Storage**: User choice is optionally saved per domain
6. **Execution**: If allowed, popup is opened using original window.open function

## Key Features

- **Maximum Aggression**: Blocks window.open, alert, confirm, prompt, and target="_blank" links
- **User Choice**: Clean UI for allowing/blocking popups
- **Domain Memory**: Remember choices per website
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows notifications when popups are blocked/allowed
- **Event System**: Dispatches custom events for testing and monitoring

## Testing

Use `test_popup_integration.html` to verify:
- All popup functions are properly overridden
- Events are properly dispatched
- User interface appears correctly
- Storage and decision handling works

## Cleanup Completed

- Removed duplicate message listeners
- Removed old popupBlockerSettings system
- Removed handlePopupBlocked function
- Consolidated popup handling into new system
- Removed temporary files

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified:
- `manifest.json` - Added content scripts, permissions, web accessible resources
- `service_worker.js` - Integrated popup handling system
- `content.js` - Enhanced with popup coordination logic

### Created:
- `popup_blocker.js` - Popup decision handler
- `test_popup_integration.html` - Integration test file

### Existing (from popup_version):
- `popup_blocker.html` - Updated with clean UI
- `popup_detector.js` - Already existed, working correctly
- `popup_rules.json` - Empty array, ready for future rules

The integration is now complete and ready for testing!
